# RADPALS

Type: lore
Entity: universe

RADPALS never set out to be heroes.
They simply refused to stay quiet while injustice survived the end of the world.

In the ruins of civilization, remnants of the old powers still rule—controlling water, food, and safe routes while crushing those with nothing.
RADPALS rise as a disruptive, unruly force, deliberately crashing into that system.
They sabotage control, break monopolies, and strike back at anyone who profits from oppression.

To those in power, RADPALS are a problem.
To the oppressed, they are the only ones willing to act.

They don’t play clean.
They don’t ask permission.
But every act of chaos they create has a purpose: to destroy injustice.

RADPALS are not polished symbols of hope.
They are the necessary disturbance that allows the powerless to breathe again.

In a broken world, RADPALS choose one role:
chaos for the oppressors, protection for the oppressed.
