NOXIE — THE BREAKRUNNER

In a world of cracked roads and collapsed cities, most people stopped running.
Noxie learned how to move through the wreckage.

When cities shattered and old routes became unusable, she modified her roller skates to survive broken terrain—sliding through fractured concrete, twisted steel, and split asphalt. She doesn’t look for safe paths. She creates them.

People started calling her The Breakrunner because she is the only one who can move fast where the ground is already broken. When pursuit ends and systems fail, she keeps moving.

To RADPALS, Noxie is the beginning and the exit fast in, faster out.
To the outside world, her name isn’t a warning.

It’s the moment they never had time to react.
